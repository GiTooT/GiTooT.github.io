I accpet the fact of being a geek :)! However, I don't stay on my laptop all day long. I do like sports, going to movies, having a beer with some cool people. Playing computer games from time to time. I recently join the <a href="http://lanets.ca/">Lan ETS</a> club at the university.

<p>
When I'm not at school or doing sport, I must be at starbuck enjoying a coffe whit some nice people or coding on some projets at a table.
