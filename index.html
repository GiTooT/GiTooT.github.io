<div class="col-md-7">
<p>Hey i'm Philippe,nice you got here!</p>

<p>Currently i just started my Bachelor of Softwate Engineering at<br/> <strong class="beBold">École de technologie supérieure </strong></p>

<p>
I love coding web applications and working on various systems as linux (ubunto 10,0), OSX Montain Lion, Windows 7. I am always looking to learn the most from my various projects!. Javascript as a front-end is great but i do work with back-end technologies. From C# to JAVA passing to .NET and PHP.
</p>

<p>
I accept the fact of being a geek :)! However, I don't stay on my laptop all day long. I do like sports, going to movies, having a beer with some cool people. Playing computer games from time to time. I recently join the <a href="http://lanets.ca/">Lan ETS</a> club at the university.
</p>
<p>
When I'm not at school or doing sport, I must be at starbuck enjoying a coffe whit some nice people or coding on some projets at a table.
